Make a program for an ATM. The program should ask the user for the value of and then inform how many bills of each value will be delivered. The available notes will be 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 reais.
The minimum amount is 10 reais and the maximum is 600 reais. The program should not worry about the amount of banknotes in the machine.
